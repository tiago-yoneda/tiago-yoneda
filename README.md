## Welcome to my Github homepage

I'm Tiago Yoneda, 33 old from Brazil.
I started learning to code on November/2020 when I joined Trybe, a big startup that begun in 2019. (https://www.betrybe.com/)

So far I've only been coding for Trybe's projects, but I do plan to do some personal projects.

 - Module 1 - Unix & Bash, Git, JS ES6, DOM, HTML & CSS, HoFs and Unit tests

 - Currently on module 4 - Basic Python, Data IO(JSON and CSV) and Tests.
