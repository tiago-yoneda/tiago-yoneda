Welcome to my Github homepage

I'm Tiago Yoneda, 33 old from Brazil.
I started learning to code on November/2020 when I joined Trybe, a big startup that begun in 2019. (https://www.betrybe.com/)

So far I've only been coding for Trybe's projects, but I do plan to do some personal projects.

I already have finished my Front-End module - In which I learned React (components, events and states, life cicles, router and TRL tests, also redux, contextAPI and React Hooks).

Currently I'm learning to manipulate databases using MYSQL Workbench in the Back-end module.
